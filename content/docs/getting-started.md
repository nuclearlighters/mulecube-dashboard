This guide will help you set up your MuleCube and connect your first device.

## What's in the Box

Your MuleCube package includes:

- **MuleCube unit** — The main device with pre-installed software
- **Power adapter** — 5V/5A USB-C power supply
- **Quick start card** — WiFi credentials and basic instructions

## First Power On

### Step 1: Connect Power

1. Plug the USB-C power adapter into the port marked **"PWR"**

3. The status LED will turn **solid green** when powered

> **Note:** MuleCube can also run on battery. For first-time setup, we recommend using the power adapter to ensure a stable connection.

### Step 2: Wait for Boot

MuleCube takes approximately **60-90 seconds** to fully boot. During this time:

- The green LED will blink
- The WiFi network will not be visible yet
- This is normal — all 30+ services need to initialize

When boot is complete:
- The LED will turn **solid green**
- The **MuleCube** WiFi network will appear

### Step 3: Connect to WiFi

On your phone, tablet, or laptop:

1. Open WiFi settings
2. Look for network: **MuleCube**
3. Enter password: **mulecube** (default)
4. Wait for connection

> **Security:** Change the default password after setup! See [Network Setup](network.md).

### Step 4: Open the Dashboard

Once connected to MuleCube WiFi:

1. Open any web browser
2. Go to: **http://192.168.42.1**
3. The MuleCube dashboard will load

You can also use:
- http://mulecube.local (if your device supports mDNS)
- http://cube.local
